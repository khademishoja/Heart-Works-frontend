## What are we building?

We are building a webapp where people can put up their artworks for auction and encourage other people to make more art. It is called `Heart Works`. It has multiple pages:

- Signup & Login pages (already implemented in the starter kit)
- A page with a list of artworks up for auction
- A detail page for artworks where you can bid or `heart` an artwork
- A form where you start an auction
- A page for artists to post new work
- A page for artist to see their own work

As a starting point, you must use the following react-redux & express templates where the login / signup flow has already been implemented. Instructions on how to use the templates can be found on the repositories themselves.
