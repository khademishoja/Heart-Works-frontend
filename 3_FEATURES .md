- Any user, logged in or not should be able to click a button `give heart`
- It increases the `hearts` property of an artwork by 1

### 4. As a user interested in buying people's art, I want to be able to make a bid, so I can show my interest in buying an artwork

- On the detail page for an artwork there should be a form with 1 field: `amount`
- This form allows a user to make a bid
- This should only be possible when a user is logged in
- The email value for the bid can be taken from the Redux store
- Alternatively make an input for the email as well
- The minimum value of the form should be the highest bid + 1 euro

| 4. Criteria - Bidding                                                                           | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| When a user is logged in we can see an number input for amount and button to `Bid`              | 1      |
| When the `Bid` button is pressed, it makes a POST request to the server to create a new `Bid`   | 2      |
| The bid created in the database has the correct `artworkId`                                     | 1      |
| The new bid can be seen on the page without refreshing                                          | 2      |
| The auth middleware is used on the server side to authorize the request and it works            | 1      |
| The minimum value of the input for amount in the frontend is the highest bid amount + 1         | 1      |
| If there are no bids yet the minimum value is the `minimumBid` value from the artwork           | 2      |
| The backend validates that the new bid is the highest bid so far uses correct HTTP codes if not | 2      |
| Total                                                                                           | 12     |
