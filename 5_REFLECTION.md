# Final Assessment - Reflection

## Looking at the process of completing this assessment:

### 1. What did you do well
 I was able to search in the previous projects that we used before and search on the internet to find solutions to a new project.
 I had good time management.
 I had some codes that didn't work, and I was able to find this problem with debugging and solved the problem, which I'm very happy about.

### 2. What would you do differently next time to improve

Next time, I will definitely read the questions once and then start working. Because this mistake caused me stress when I got to question 5.
I try to rest more and have regular sleep. I slept very little during the assessment.
To write some code, I used a sample code and search on the internet, which worries me and I must practice more to solve this
